## VoTaro

ROUGH DRAFT:
VoTaro is an Ethereum application that uses a reward system to encourage residents of Queretaro to propose and participate in activities that will improve their community.

New users are first instructed to install MetaMask and then connect to the application and get validated.  Because the focus is on people who live in Queretaro, a quiz about Queretaro is used to check the validity of potential users.  When validated, a user receives TARO tokens and becomes eligible to offer community proposals.  More TARO tokens are received for the first five proposals a user makes.

Proposals are voted upon, and if passed and the proposed activity is carried out, the proposer is receives TARO.  One TARO token is worth one vote.  Anyone with TARO can delegate their voting power to another TARO holder.  After the first five proposals, a user must have received one percent of the total voting power to make a proposal.  

TARO is a modified version of Compound's COMP smart contract.  The major difference is that TARO brings Compound's governance structure into a real world setting and uses the incentive of earning more tokens as a way to promote community activity.

This application would not be practical currently on Ethereum due to slow transaction speeds and high gas costs.  Therefore a layer two solution, SKALE Network, is used as the platform for VoTaro.  SKALE provides VoTaro speed and security in the near term, while offering the possibility for expansion over time.
